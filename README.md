#Visual Scripting System
This is a visual scripting system that generates C++11 code for integration into a larger codebase.
It is written in Python 3 and uses the TkInter library.

To register functions, write them or include them in vscript.h
To add modules put them into the modules folder and add their paths to modules.txt.

The template is:
Name
Requirements - angle bracket or quote enclosed filenames separated by a space
argument
([return]) = code...([argument]);

Arguments are also separated by spaces.

Note: This configuration is set up for the Game architecture engine.  To build outside of the engine, clear modules.txt.

Warning: A blank return node must have the cursor in its entry box at some point before compilation.

# ga Final
This is the C++ part of my final project.
It is forked from the beginning of hw7 and includes the code generated by my scriptng system

To integrate scripts into the current engine, the script function must be either void vsupdate(Reference, Reference) or void vsupdate(void*, void*)
